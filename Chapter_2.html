    <h1>Chapter 2. The Hunt for a Murderer</h1>
    <h3>Police Christian D</h3>
    <p>Police Commander Christian D, serving in Police car 1520 with Thomas E as driver, was on Kungsträdgårdsgatan inspecting the starting point for Saturday's Swedish Rally Championship competitions when the alarm about the shooting came. The patrol immediately drove towards the area via Hamngatan, Regeringsgatan, and further onto David Bagares gata. The journey was quick, but only blue lights were activated.</p>
    <p>When the patrol turned onto David Bagares gata in the direction of Malmskillnadsgatan, they noticed a younger man walking in the middle of the street – Lars J. The police car passed him without stopping. Further up the street, Christian D observed four policemen coming up the stairs.</p>
    <h3>Lars J</h3>
    <p>Lars J, who on this occasion was on his way down David Bagares gata, met the police car about the height of Johannesgatan. He made eye contact with the policemen in the car, but the patrol drove past without stopping, and Lars did not make himself known either.</p>
    <p>He then looked into Johannesgatan to see if any person could be glimpsed, but the street was empty. Lars continued a bit further down David Bagares gata before turning around. When he looked up the street, he saw that the police car was now parked at the top of the street. He then made the decision to go forward and talk to the police.</p>
    <h3>The four police officers from 3230</h3>
    <p>The four police officers from patrol 3230 have now come up the stairs after meeting Yvonne and Ahmed. They are divided into two patrols.</p>
    <h4>Peter W and Klas G make up one of the patrols and turn left in the direction of Johannes kyrka</h4>
    <p>They stop on several occasions and shine their flashlights under scaffolding that was then along Malmskillnadsgatan. Once at the fire station, right where the church area begins, the two policemen stop for a short while. Klas turns around and looks south along Malmskillnadsgatan. He then sees the front of a police car and thinks he remembers that it is Claes D standing next to the car.</p>
    <p>Klas and Peter continue through the cemetery via a park road, but do not make any observations inside the church area.</p>
    <h4>The other patrol, Claes D and Jan H, goes towards David Bagares Gata</h4>
    <p>They see Police Christian D in Unit 1520 come up to them. Down the street, they see Lars J walking up the street. This patrol then departs, and Unit 1520 backs down to meet Lars J.</p>
    <p>Lars states that a man has been shot on Sveavägen, and that he followed the perpetrator but lost him along the street they are now standing on.</p>
    <p>During the conversation, a radio call comes from patrol 2160, which has found a man matching the description at the intersection of Regeringsgatan and Mäster Samuelsgatan.</p>
    <p>Christian D then orders Jan H to escort the witness Lars to the murder scene, where the police can record his information. Christian D then proceeds to assist patrol 2160.</p>
    <p>Claes D is left alone at the scene.</p>
    <!-- Claes D is left alone at the scene. -->
    <p>[Commentary/Author's Note]: The fact that Claes D is left alone at the scene is a circumstance I will return to in the section on the police trail. Just a few minutes earlier, patrol 3230 had been in the area to park Claes D's private car, which is now standing a few meters further down the street. Claes D resides in this neighborhood, which explains why patrol 3230 is operating outside its regular district of Södermalm.</p>

    <P>The man stopped by patrol 2160 was checked, and he stated that he had recently left the Chinese restaurant Peking on Regeringsgatan. The police verified this information, and an employee at the restaurant confirmed that the man had indeed just departed after being on the premises for at least two hours. The man identified himself and was subsequently released.</P>
    <p>Christian D from patrol 1520 then went down to the murder scene.</p>
