        At the moment I am incarcerated at the prison Hall, and have also been an inmate at the prison Kumla. During the time I sat at Kumla there was a guy from Stockholm named Christer Pettersson who is almost a copy of the picture of Olof Palme's murderer. I can't remember what year it was, but it's in the eighties, maybe 1984! Hope this can be of interest to Holmér. Maybe it will be a hit for you! Good luck!</p>

            Regarding red number: 697 concerning a Christer Pettersson<br />
            On Monday, May 26, 1986, at 11:15 a.m., Christer was visited at his home by Detective Inspectors Lennart P and Anders L. The following emerged:<br />
            On the night of the murder, Christer was in Stockholm city. He visited the "club" on Oxtorgsgatan – 2 floors underground – called BK OXEN. There he met, among others, a "guy" named Sigvard C – a known ruffian. Sigvard C resides at Tegnérgatan 16.<br />
            Christer arrived at the club around 7:00 p.m. and departed from there just after 10:00 p.m. when he went to Centralen and took the "commuter train" home to Rotebro. Christer arrived home around 11:30 p.m. and went to bed almost immediately. In the morning, when he woke up around 8:00 a.m., he went to get the newspaper – DN – and then learned about the murder. Since Christer is a "true friend" of Olof Palme, he sat down at the kitchen table and cried.

    <p>On April 23, 1987, at 1:10 p.m., an investigator named Hans H called Christer to check an alibi. Ulf S, a friend of Christer’s, had told the police—when asked what he was doing the night of the murder—that he was at Christer’s place. </p>

            Entry No. D 44<br />
            Ulf S, the one pointed out in the tip-off, has stated Pettersson as an alibi for his activities on February 28, 1986.<br />Pettersson was contacted today, April 23, 1987 at 1:10 p.m. by telephone and I told him that a person had stated that he had been at home in his apartment on February 28, 1986.<br />
            Pettersson then replied spontaneously: It was Ulf S - he came to me at 7 - 8 p.m. before I went into town and was allowed to stay in the apartment when I left<br />
            Ulf S stayed because he hoped I would get him some amphetamines in town, but I couldn't get any.<br />
            When I got back to the apartment at 11.30 p.m., he was lying on the floor and slept off the high.<br />
            Spinnars stayed for a while before he went home - don't know exactly what time it was then.<br />
            I have previously been questioned by the police in the Palme murder together with Sigge C regarding my activities on the night of the murder - you must have papers for it with you, there were four police officers here in May 1986.<br />
            This information is correct - copies in case M:4248 are attached.<br />
