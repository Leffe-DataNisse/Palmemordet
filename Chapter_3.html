    <h1>Chapter 3 - Hans Holmér</h1>
    <h2>Hans Holmér Takes the Lead</h2>
    <h3>Hans Holmér is going to participate in the Vasaloppet.</h3>
    <p>At noon on Friday, Hans Holmér leaves his office at the police headquarters to participate in the Vasaloppet – a 90-kilometer (approximately 56-mile) classic cross-country ski race for elite and amateur skiers – which is always held on the first Sunday in March. This is going to be the eighth time in a row that Hans has participated in the race.</p>
    <p>Hans and his new partner, Åsa, drive to Borlänge halfway to Sälen where the start is located, and spend the night at the Scandic hotel.</p>
    <p>Early next morning, before breakfast is served at the hotel, Hans goes to the check-in desk to ask to fill a thermos with hot water. The girl at the desk asks him if he has heard about the murder. "No," he replies, "Here in Borlänge?" "No, in Stockholm. Palme has been shot," the girl continues.</p>
    <p>Hans calls SBC, and Gilbert N, who has relieved Hans K as the duty officer, answers. Gilbert describes the situation in Stockholm. Gilbert says, "Gösta says you can go ahead and ski the Vasaloppet," referring to Deputy County Police Chief Gösta Welander. "I'll be there in a couple of hours," Hans replies.</p>
    <h3>Hans Holmér Arrives at SBC</h3>
    <p>During the night of the murder, Deputy County Police Chief Gösta Welander was leader for the Stockholm police. When County Chief of Police Hans Holmér arrived approximately 10:50 a.m. on the morning of March 1, he took over leadership.</p>
    <p>Hans Holmér believed that since the murder had occurred in Stockholm, the investigation should be led by the Stockholm police. He therefore appointed himself as chief of investigation.</p>
    <p>The national murder commission was on assignment elsewhere and sat in their hotel rooms waiting for the phone to ring; it never did.</p>

    <p>At 12:00 p.m., Hans Holmér held his first of many press conferences.</p>
