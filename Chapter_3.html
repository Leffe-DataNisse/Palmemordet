    <h1>Chapter 3 - Hans Holm√©r</h1>
    <h2>Hans Holm√©r Takes the Lead</h2>
    <h3>Hans Holm√©r is going to participate in the Vasaloppet.</h3>
    <p>At noon on Friday, Hans Holm√©r leaves his office at the police headquarters to participate in the Vasaloppet ‚Äì a 90-kilometer (approximately 56-mile) classic cross-country ski race for elite and amateur skiers ‚Äì which is always held on the first Sunday in March. This is going to be the eighth time in a row that Hans has participated in the race.</p>
    <p>Hans and his new partner, √Ösa, drive to Borl√§nge halfway to S√§len where the start is located, and spend the night at the Scandic hotel.</p>
    <p>Early next morning, before breakfast is served at the hotel, Hans goes to the check-in desk to ask to fill a thermos with hot water. The girl at the desk asks him if he has heard about the murder. "No," he replies, "Here in Borl√§nge?" "No, in Stockholm. Palme has been shot," the girl continues.</p>
    <p>Hans calls SBC, and Gilbert N, who has relieved Hans K as the duty officer, answers. Gilbert describes the situation in Stockholm. Gilbert says, "G√∂sta says you can go ahead and ski the Vasaloppet," referring to Deputy County Police Chief G√∂sta Welander. "I'll be there in a couple of hours," Hans replies.</p>
    <h3>Hans Holm√©r Arrives at SBC</h3>
    <p>During the night of the murder, Deputy County Police Chief G√∂sta Welander was leader for the Stockholm police. When County Chief of Police Hans Holm√©r arrived approximately 10:50 a.m. on the morning of March 1, he took over leadership.</p>
    <p>Hans Holm√©r believed that since the murder had occurred in Stockholm, the investigation should be led by the Stockholm police. He therefore appointed himself as chief of investigation.</p>
    <p>The national murder commission was on assignment elsewhere and sat in their hotel rooms waiting for the phone to ring; it never did.</p>
    <!--f√∂rs√∂ka f√• bekr√§ftelse i Borl√§nge, mordet p√• Dagny Lindholm? -->
    <p>At 12:00 p.m., Hans Holm√©r held his first of many press conferences.</p>
    <h3>The Palme-Group is Formed</h3>
    <p>This group comprised several leading personnel representing the departments that would be involved in the murder investigation.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>From the Stockholm Police Authority:</b></li>
        <li>Hans Wranghult, Chief Superintendent and Head of the Criminal Department</li>
        <li>Lennart Pettersson, Police Superintendent and Head of the Investigation Section</li>
        <li>Nils Linder, Commissioner and Head of the Violent Crimes Unit</li>
        <li>Vincent Lange, Commissioner and Head of the Forensic Department</li>
        <li><b>From the National Police Board:</b></li>
        <li>Tommy Lindstr√∂m, Chief Superintendent and Head of the National Criminal Police</li>
        <li>Per-G√∂ran N√§ss, a Bureau Chief from the Security Police (S√§po)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The group also included a representative ('observer') from the Ministry of Justice, Legal Counsel Klas Bergenstrand.</p>
    <p>The Palme Group meets twice a day to discuss the progress of the investigation and coordinate efforts. A fragmented protocol is kept, and the meetings were taped, but only small portions of these recordings have been released, just enough to confirm their existence.</p>

    <h3>A second Bullet is Found</h3>

    <h2>The Composite sketches</h2>
    <p>On March 4, the Palme Group contacted the BKA in Wiesbaden to request a machine capable of creating composite sketches. The following evening, German police from the BKA arrived with the composite sketch machine in Stockholm and the equipment was set up in a hotel room at Hotel Amaranten.</p>
    <p>Twenty-two witnesses who had provided descriptions of individuals potentially involved in the murder of Olof Palme were chosen to participate in the creation of the composite sketches. The observations were made between Christmas 1985 and February 28, 1986.</p>
    <h3>The Ghost Image</h3>
    <p>On March 6, at 8:00 a.m., the first image was made public. It claimed to resemble a possible perpetrator. This image became widely known as 'The Ghost Image,' and it is this image we refer to when mentioning 'The Ghost Image.'</p>

    <p>Susanne T (√§ven kallad ‚Äùtecknerskan‚Äù), den 28 februari 1986 mellan kl</p>

        <p class="img-source">The police</p>
    </div>

    <p>The observation upon which the image was based had been made by a woman, Susanne T (also known as 'the sketch artist'), on February 28, 1986, between 11:30 p.m. and 11:40 p.m. At this time, Susanne T had briefly left the Alexandra restaurant, where she was, and exited onto Smala Gr√§nd via the staff entrance. As she opened the gate towards Smala Gr√§nd, she had almost bumped into a man who was walking hunched over, with his hands in his trouser pockets. When the man saw her, he had looked startled and turned away. He then quickened his pace, and at Snickarbacken, he had turned right towards Birger Jarlsgatan. Susanne T had provided a detailed description of the man and had also made her own drawing of him.</p>

        <p class="img-source">The police</p>
    </div>
    <p>Why the police specifically chose this image remains somewhat of a mystery. The observation made by Susanne T occurred 1,350 feet (400 meters) from the crime scene and had no direct connection to the crime. The simple explanation is that it was the best description available, but some evil tongues suggest it was selected because it was the image that most resembled a Kurd.</p>
    <h3>The Shadow Image</h3>
    <p>On March 24, at 10:00 a.m., a second composite sketch was released, known as 'The Shadow Image'</p>
    <div class="image-container">

    </div>
    <P>The observation upon which the image was based had been made by a man, Patricio M, on Thursday, February 27, when Olof Palme was out shopping for a suit. Patricio saw a man who seemed to be following Palme as Palme was crossing Sergels Torg.</P>

    <h2>The "33-year-old".</h2>
    <div style=" text-align: center; margin: 20px; color: hotpink;">
        <p><i>In the section on Viktor Gunnarsson, I have not read all the police reports; this part is based on second-hand information mainly from "Report of the Inquiry Commission regarding the Criminal Investigation following the Murder of Prime Minister Olof Palme (SOU 1999:88)". I am still including it in the text and hope to do better at a later date.</i></p>
    </div>

    <h3>Misstankar riktas mot 33-√•ringen.</h3>
    <p>Shortly after the murder, police began to receive tips about a man named Viktor Gunnarson.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>En ung kvinna inkom till polisen ett tips redan kv√§llen efter mordet. Hon ber√§ttade att hon kv√§llen innan varit p√• kaf√© Mon Ch√©ri p√• Kungsgatan tillsammans med tv√• v√§ninnor. De hade kommit i samspr√•k med en man som uttalat sitt hat mot Olof Palme. Mannen hade l√§mnat √∂ver ett visitkort med namnet Vic G och telefonnummer.</li>
        <li>En anonym kvinna tipsade om att Viktor, som sj√§lv uppgivit att han stridit f√∂r USA mot Nord Vietnam, hade yttrat ‚ÄùOlof Palme √§r f√∂r konservativ och st√•r p√• KGB:s lista f√∂r avr√§ttning. Blod kommer att flyta‚Äù.</li>
        <li>En annan person tipsade om att Viktor, som var medlem i en ytterlighetsorganisation, hade talat om att st√∂rta Olof Palme.</li>
        <li>En kvinna och en man tipsade polisen om att en person de k√§nde, Viktor, hade ett s√•dant vapen som de sett i tidningen efter mordet. De ber√§ttade ocks√• att Viktor G ofta h√•llit till p√• V√§sterl√•nggatan, att han ogillade Olof Palme, att han pl√∂tsligt haft 30 000 kr till l√§genhets k√∂p och att han sagt att han var utbildad av FBI och CIA.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In Swedish legal practice, the police run the investigation until a suspect is identified, at which point the prosecutor takes over. In this case, Chief Prosecutor K.G. Svensson took over the part of the investigation that involved Viktor Gunnarsson.</p>
    <P>On March 6, K.G. Svensson assumed the role of lead investigator concerning Viktor G.</P>
    <p>On March 8, K.G. Svensson decided that Viktor Gunnarsson should be brought in for questioning, and a search warrant was executed at his home at Kl√∂verv√§gen 6 in Norsborg, a suburb south-west of Stockholm.</p>
    <p>Victor G. tells the investigators that he had been at a caf√©, Mon Ch√©ri, on the evening of February 28, where he had conversed with three girls. He believes he had then attended a late-night show at the Rigoletto cinema on Kungsgatan, and that he might have grabbed a burger at McDonald's before taking the subway back to Norsborg. However, he isn't certain.</p>
    <p>After a briefing the same evening, Hans Holm√©r decided that Viktor G should be released. The seizure that had been made in connection with the search was lifted.</p>

    </div>
    <p>On the morning of March 12, Viktor G. was brought in for new questioning. Concurrently, a new search warrant was executed at his residence. Several articles of clothing, along with other materials, were seized and handed over to the Forensic Department for trace evidence analysis that could be linked to the shooting, and for the deciphering of indented writing on certain stationery. Anti-Palme material, such as EAP documents (also known as the LaRouche movement in Sweden) with underlined anti-Palme statements, was also found and seized.</p>
    <p>In the afternoon, he was notified of suspicion of complicity in the murder of Olof Palme. He was arrested later that evening.</p>
    <p>On the afternoon of March 14, the National Laboratory of Forensic Science (SKL) informally announced that two small primer residue particles had been found on the sleeve of Viktor G.'s parka. However, the particles originated, with 100 percent and 95 percent certainty respectively, not from the same type of ammunition as the recovered bullets. The seized clothes were transferred to the Bundeskriminalamt (BKA) in Wiesbaden for further examination.</p>
    <p>On March 17, the BKA provided the preliminary feedback that it could not be ruled out that the primer residue particles on Viktor G.'s parka were from Winchester ammunition. On the same day, K.G. Svensson submitted a request for his remand in custody to the Stockholm District Court. The District Court decided that the remand hearing would take place on March 20, 1986.</p>
    <h3>The Witnesses on the Ridge</h3>
    <p>Investigator B√∂rge W arranged a line-up on March 16, and Ibrahim D identified Viktor G as the man who had stopped him.</p>
    <p>In connection with the preparations for the detention hearing, the prosecutors received a transcript of the line-up that B√∂rge W had conducted with Ibrahim D on March 16. The prosecutors then became aware that the line-up had been preceded by a photo identification that included Viktor G. Ibrahim D had thus seen a photograph of Viktor G before the line-up; this prior exposure may have influenced his identification during the line-up. Furthermore, it emerged that the line-up had been conducted without an interpreter, despite Ibrahim D speaking limited Swedish.</p>
    <P>K.G. Svensson therefore decided that a new interrogation with Ibrahim D should be conducted immediately. Svensson himself conducted the interrogation in the presence of an interpreter. At the end of the interrogation, a direct confrontation took place between Ibrahim D and Viktor G. Ibrahim D maintained that Viktor G was the man who had stopped him, but he stated that the man had worn a hood, hat, or similar, so that not much of his face had been visible. During the confrontation, Viktor G began speaking French with Ibrahim D. </P>
    <p>Following the interrogation with Ibrahim D, K.G. Svensson decided that Viktor G. should be released. However, Viktor G. remained a suspect in the murder of Olof Palme, and on the same day, at K.G. Svensson's request, the District Court decided on wiretapping concerning Viktor G. The wiretapping then continued until April 30, 1986.</p>
    <p>On May 16, K.G. Svensson decided to discontinue the preliminary investigation against Viktor G., stating that the investigation had not provided any support for the assumption that Viktor G. had been involved in the crimes, and that there was no longer any reason for the preliminary investigation to continue. Remaining seizures were lifted. With this decision, K.G. Svensson left the investigation.</p>
    <div class="quote">
        <p> Finally, regarding the prosecutor's role in the investigation concerning Viktor G., I wish to state the following. Viktor G. could have been dismissed from the murder investigation much earlier had the Palme case's leadership group not disrupted and hindered a rational process on the prosecutor's part, through its involvement in the preliminary investigation management, actions in various directions, and attempts to pressure the prosecutor through various channels. In my opinion, Viktor G. has been subjected to a serious miscarriage of justice. It is not my place to make any further statements about the question of responsibility in this regard. I welcome the government's swift intervention concerning the establishment of an inquiry commission. In my opinion, it is necessary that a comprehensive and complete review and clarification of the entire legal affair concerning Viktor G. takes place as soon as possible.<br />
        K.G. Svensson</p>
