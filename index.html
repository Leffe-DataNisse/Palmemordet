    <h1>The Murder of Olof Palme</h1>
    <p><b>On February 28, 1986, Sweden's Prime Minister Olof Palme was murdered in the street in central Stockholm. Olof and Lisbet Palme were walking home along Sveavägen after seeing the film "The Mozart Brothers" at the Grand cinema. At 11:21 PM, as the Palme couple passed the corner of Tunnelgatan/Sveavägen, a man stepped out from behind them and fired a fatal shot into Olof Palme's back. An additional shot superficially wounded Lisbet Palme. The murderer fled the scene towards David Bagares gata. The couple had no bodyguards. Who was responsible for the murder and what the motive was remain unknown.</b></p>
