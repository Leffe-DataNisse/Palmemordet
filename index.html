    <h1>The Murder of Olof Palme</h1>
    <p><b>On February 28, 1986, Sweden's Prime Minister Olof Palme was murdered in the street in central Stockholm. Olof and Lisbet Palme were walking home along Sveav√§gen after seeing the film "The Mozart Brothers" at the Grand cinema. At 11:21 PM, as the Palme couple passed the corner of Tunnelgatan/Sveav√§gen, a man stepped out from behind them and fired a fatal shot into Olof Palme's back. An additional shot superficially wounded Lisbet Palme. The murderer fled the scene towards David Bagares gata. The couple had no bodyguards. Who was responsible for the murder and what the motive was remain unknown.</b></p>
    <h3>The Palme Couple Leaves Their Home</h3>
    <p>The Palme couple leaves their home in Stockholm's Old Town <a class="map-link" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/Usoz3SLVBMMzLixf7" target="_blank"> <span style="font-size: 0.9em;">üìçvesterl√•nggatan 31</span></a> at 8:35 p.m. on a Friday evening. They walk through the narrow alleys toward the Old Town metro station, a distance of 700 feet (213 meters).</p>
    <p>The air temperature is -6.8¬∞C (19.8¬∞F) with a brisk west-south-westerly wind of 4 m/s (9 mph) sweeping through the city. The curbs are covered in ice, and pedestrians hunch against the wind, rushing forward with their hands deep in their pockets. There is also 25 cm (10 inches) of snow on the ground. </p>
    <p>Olof Palme is dressed in a gray-blue suit, a dark blue raglan coat, a white knitted scarf, dark gloves, short suede boots, and a brown-black fur hat. Lisbet Palme wears a medium brown suede coat with a brown fur collar. The bottom edges of the coat and sleeves are trimmed with fur, and it has exposed seams. She also has a dark blue scarf and a white knitted hat.</p>
    <p>When the Palme couple arrive at the Old Town metro station <a class="map-link" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/zH5bM8zzWNQ3ed7KA" target="_blank"> <span style="font-size: 0.9em;">üìç</span>Old Town metro station</a> and pass the barrier, Lisbet shows her monthly pass and Olof pays 6 kronor to the ticket inspector Sergiusz, who recognizes him and wishes him a pleasant journey.</p>
    <p>They take the stairs up to the western platform for northbound trains. After a short wait, the green line number 17 rolls into the station at 8:42 p.m. Olof enters through the back door of the second carriage. The train is crowded, so the couple stands for the three stations on their way to R√•dmansgatan. Olof holds on to a vertical pole, and Lisbet stands next to the door.</p>
    <p>At the R√•dmansgatan metro station <a class="map-link" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/R6VP4nQEx2deXjAL8" target="_blank"> <span style="font-size: 0.9em;">üìç</span>Sveav√§gen 53</a>, the Palme couple gets off and walks toward the southern entrance. Outside the barriers, Lisbet first heads in the wrong direction. Olof stops and calls out, "It's this way!" Lisbet turns and walks toward Olof, who is waiting for her. Together they walk toward the entrance at Sveav√§gen.</p>
    <p>The couple walked south on Sveav√§gen the 400 feet (125 meters) to the Grand cinema.</p>

    <h3>At the Grand Cinema</h3>
    <p>Outside the Grand cinema <a class="map-link" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/R4t2bhmvpobTCYZLA" target="_blank"> <span style="font-size: 0.9em;">üìç</span>Sveav√§gen 45</a>, the Palme couple meet their son M√•rten. They greet briefly before Olof and Lisbet go into the foyer to buy tickets. M√•rten has already been at the cinema earlier that day and bought tickets for himself and his girlfriend.</p>
    <p>The lobby is bustling with people. Olof first misunderstands the line's gender and accidentally cuts in front of a few people, but Lisbet corrects him, and he moves to the back of the line. Behind him are Curt Lidgard and his wife, whom the Palme couple knows. They talk while standing in the queue.</p>
    <p>M√•rten Palme's girlfriend Ingrid, who has arrived early at the cinema, sees the Palme couple in the ticket queue. She walks up to say hello, and Lisbet tells her that M√•rten is standing outside. Ingrid goes out into the street and sees M√•rten talking to two friends.</p>
    <p>When Olof arrives at the ticket window, the ticket seller G√∂ran recognizes him and Lisbet. The couple has arrived quite late, and there are not many good places left. G√∂ran thinks they should get good seats, so he gives them two tickets that are pre-ordered for director at the Sandrew cinemas, booked by his secretary.</p>
    <p>The Palme couple ends up in row 8, close to the aisle in the middle of Auditorium 1‚Äîthe largest of the four theaters at the Grand cinema. M√•rten and his girlfriend are sitting diagonally behind them.</p>
    <p>Confederation of Professional Employees chairman Bj√∂rn Rosengren and his wife Agneta see that Olof Palme is sitting in front of him. During the commercials, they talk to each other and plan a meeting when Olof returns from the Nordic Council in Copenhagen, where he was supposed to travel on Monday. Lisbet feeds Olof candies and says that they should stop talking about work and enjoy the movie.</p>
    <p>When the performance of "The Mozart Brothers" ends, the Palme couple lingers and leaves the auditorium only when it's almost empty.</p>
    <p>Anna, a young girl, sees Olof Palme in the lobby and walks up to him. She thinks the film is so good that there should be greater cultural funding to make good Swedish films. She says this to Olof, who seems bothered and doesn't answer. The Palme couple then walks out through the doors to Sveav√§gen.</p>
    <p>Outside the cinema, the Palme couple meet their son M√•rten. They walk a bit south because there are a lot of people on the street. Outside a bookstore, they stop to discuss the film. Olof has a film magazine and wants to read the cast ‚Äì he has previously been offered a role in the film but turned it down. He walks up to the shop window to catch the light, but just then it goes out. He and M√•rten think it's strange and stare in to see if anyone is still in the store.</p>
    <p>M√•rten suggests that they take a taxi home to the parents to drink tea. Lisbet thinks it's late, and Olof says that he's been sitting all day and wants to stretch his legs. They decide to part ways.</p>
    
    <h3>Walking Home</h3>
    <p>M√•rten and his girlfriend walk north toward Ingrid's apartment on Vanadisv√§gen, while the Palme couple walks south toward their home in the Old Town.</p>
    <p>As they pass the hot dog stand, located on Sveav√§gen <a class="map-link" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/Qam92AivcMPCQszM9" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: 0.9em;">üìç</span>Sveav√§gen 39</a> just before the intersection with Adolf Fredriks kyrkogata, the proprietor Najic sees them. He watches Olof and Lisbet Palme walking along Sveav√§gen. About 48 feet (15 meters) in front of the couple are two well-dressed men, and about 32 feet (10 meters) behind them is another man. Najic gets the impression that the latter man has poor taste in clothes. He is preoccupied with a customer, and when he looks up again, the couple is gone. He only sees the two men who have gone on ahead, further up Sveav√§gen.</p>
    <p>The couple crosses the intersection of Sveav√§gen and Adolf Fredriks kyrkogata. On the other side, Lisbet stops at the shop window of the shop Sari <a class="map-link" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/LXg6KgkWPMF9JmQ97" target="_blank"> <span style="font-size: 0.9em;">üìç</span>Sveav√§gen 48</a>, which sells Indian clothes. That's where her dress for the Nobel banquet had been mended. During their continued walk south, Lisbet walks to Olof's right.</p>
    <p>Nicola F is on his way home from his job as a chef on Kungsgatan and walks north along Sveav√§gen. Level with the entrance to number 44, outside the La Cartarie shop, he catches sight of the Palme couple. They are about 64 feet (20 meters) in front of him and are moving south at a leisurely walking pace</p>
    <p>After about half the distance, they meet, and Nicola passes the couple. He walks closest to the street, while Olof Palme stays closest to the building wall. Nicola notices a man working in the store's window, and another man walking 16 to 32 feet (5 to 10 meters) behind the couple.</p>
    <p>The man behind is wearing a blue jacket. Nicola perceives him as older and thinks he is too old to be a security guard. The jacket resembles a Tenson jacket, reaches to the middle of the thigh, and has a blue color reminiscent of the back of a Stockholm telephone directory from the era.</p>

    <h4 class="paragraph-title">The shot against Olof Palme:</h4>
    <p>The shot that killed Olof Palme was fired from a distance of about 4‚Äì12 inches(10‚Äì30 cm) . The bullet entered through the back seam of his coat, approximately at shoulder blade height, crushed the spine, tore the body's major artery and trachea, and exited through the chest. Injuries of this type are not compatible with life. They cause the legs to immediately fold and the body to collapse to the ground. Olof Palme died instantly.</p>
    <h4 class="paragraph-title">The shot against Lisbet Palme:</h4>
    <P>The shot fired against Lisbet Palme was fired from a distance of about 27‚Äì39 inches (70‚Äì100 cm). It entered through her suede coat on the left side of her back, approximately at shoulder blade height, tore the clothes she was wearing underneath, caused a scratch along her back, and exited through the right side of the back of the suede coat.</P>


    <h3>Witness Anders B</h3>
    <p>Anders B has been at a company party at the St. Clara restaurant and is now on his way to an afterparty at the K√•ren disco on Holl√§ndargatan 51. His group plans to first withdraw money at an ATM on Sveav√§gen. While waiting for his friends, he changes his mind and decides to go home instead.</p>
    <p>After leaving his friends at the ATM, Anders walks right behind the Palme couple. He sees what he perceives as a group of three people in front of him. They are ahead of him by at least what seems like 16 feet (5 meters) of walking time. They seem to be having a good time and are chatting with each other.</p>
    <p>Two bangs can be heard from the group in front. Anders is only about 3 meters (10 feet) behind them. Anders perceives the sound as firecrackers. The person walking in the middle immediately falls to the ground, and a cloud of smoke rises that slowly disperses. The woman screams something that Anders interprets as a foreign language.</p>
    <p>After the shots, Anders takes shelter in a recess of a doorway‚Äîthe goods entrance to the Dekorima store‚Äîand therefore does not see much of the perpetrator's escape.</p>

    <h3>Witness Leif J</h3>
    <p>Leif is driving south in the left lane on Sveav√§gen, approaching the intersection with Tunnelgatan. In front of him is a taxi, which he perceives to be a light-colored Mercedes. He hears a bang, then another. It quickly becomes clear that something serious has happened</p>
    <p>The taxi, which is further ahead at the intersection, immediately makes a U-turn and stops at the curb, beside a man lying on the street. Leif performs the same maneuver and stops his car in front of the taxi.</p>
    <p>He picks up the handset of his mobile phone and dials 90 000 for the Alarm Center. He dials the number twice, unsure if he needs to dial the area code first. The call is registered with the Alarm Center at 11:22:20 p.m. Leif says: "Yes... there's a murder on Sveav√§gen."</p>
    <p>In the background, alarm operator Sonja can be heard saying to her colleagues: "murder on Sveav√§gen," before she uses a number transmitter to forward the call to the police switchboard. While Leif waits for an answer, fragments of a discussion can be heard from the street.</p>
    <p>According to the LAC log, which records all calls to the Alarm Center synchronized with the 'Miss Ur' time service, Leif's call was cut off at 11:23:40 p.m.‚Äîjust before the police answered: "Police... Hello." The log provides an exact time marker for the call's duration.</p>
    <p>At the request of the police, Leif carries out a reconstruction of the events. He concludes that it takes 43-45 seconds from the first shot until he calls the Alarm Center and is connected. This places the time of the first shot at approximately 11:21:35 p.m.</p>

    <h3>Witness Hans J</h3>
    <p>Hans J is the driver of the light-colored Mercedes that Leif J sees. As his car is still rolling, Hans starts to call the switchboard. First, he presses the button for Stockholm's taxi switchboard, but the call is put in a queue. He could have asked for priority, but in his excitement, he didn't think about it. Instead, he picks up the microphone and calls Solna Taxi directly.</p>
    <p>It takes about ten seconds from the shot until he makes contact with a woman at the switchboard‚ÄîIngrid Z. When the call is connected, he is already at the scene of the crime, and his passenger has rushed out of the car and approached the man lying on the ground. Hans announces that someone has been shot at the Sveav√§gen-Apelbergsgatan intersection. The switchboard promises to contact the police. He has the street wrong, however; Apelbergsgatan is the next intersection to the south.</p>

    <p>Ingrid Z is working in Solna Taxi's switchboard when taxi 344‚Äîa Stockholm car‚Äîcalls her via radio. He shouts: "Solna Taxi, Solna Taxi!" and continues: "Hurry up, hurry up, there's a shooting going on ‚Äì someone is shooting!" The address given is Sveav√§gen at Apelbergsgatan.</p>
    <p>The switchboard operator immediately dials the speed dial for the Stockholm police's command center. She has to wait a couple of minutes before anyone answers. The policeman who finally takes the call seems younger and annoyed by her haste. He replies, "We'll see what we can do," in a way that truly irritates her.</p>
    <p>Ingrid Z calls out to car 344, which she believes is the car that first alerted her. She receives no answer. A colleague advises her to call car 744, and she makes contact there. The taxi driver then informs her that the victim is Olof Palme.</p>
    <p>The switchboard operator immediately calls Aftonbladet, a major Swedish tabloid newspaper, and tells them what happened, but is not believed at first.</p>
    <p>When the driver first called her, she noted the time directly in her log: 11:22 PM. She has a clock directly in front of her and always makes a habit of writing down the time when something significant occurs‚Äîand she immediately understood that this was such an event.</p>

    <h3>Witness Anders D</h3>
    <p>Anders D is a taxi driver working at night. He has picked up three young women from Barkarby station and is driving them to Kungstr√§dg√•rden.</p>

    </div> 
    <p>On Sveav√§gen, he gets a red light at the intersection with Tunnelgatan. While waiting for the light to turn green, he looks around. On the east side of the street, he sees three people: a man and a couple standing and talking. The lone man stands with his back to the building.</p>
    <p>When the light turns green and Anders starts to move into the intersection, he hears a loud bang from the direction of the three people. He turns his head to see what's happening and hears another bang.</p>
    <p>He sees that the man who had been standing with his back to the building's facade is holding a weapon in his right hand, aimed at the couple. He sees a flash of fire and smoke from the weapon, which has a long barrel‚Äîlike a Colt.</p>
    <p>A man falls to the ground. The perpetrator runs onto Tunnelgatan, in the direction of Luntmakargatan.</p>
    <p>Anders estimates that the fleeing man is about 180-185 cm (5'11" to 6'1") tall. He has no idea of the man's age, but notes that he does not move with the agility of a younger man‚Äîhis step is somewhat slow. The man wears a gray hat pulled down over his forehead and a grayish Ulster coat with black speckles. His face is not visible.</p>
    <!-- Anders rings J√§rf√§lla Taxi's switchboard -->
    <p>Anders pulls over to the right, west side of Sveav√§gen, stopping at the curb. He contacts the J√§rf√§lla Taxi switchboard via radio, and operator Ann-Louise answers. Anders tells her that a man has been shot and asks her to call the police.</p>
    <p>Ann-Louise can't find the number for the police's direct line, but a person in the room gives her a direct number to the Stockholm Police's Liaison Centre (SBC). She calls there and reports that someone has been shot at the intersection of Sveav√§gen and Tunnelgatan.</p>
    <p>Radio operator Ulf H at the Liaison Centre asks Ann-Louise to contact the driver and ask him to stay at the scene until the police arrive. He then ends the call. Ann-Louise contacts Anders via radio, informs him that the police are on their way, and asks him to wait.</p>
    <p>The telephone message from Ann-Louise leads to an intervention message (IM) being registered by Ulf in the Liaison Centre's computerized system at 11:23 p.m. Since this is the registration time, the call must have started shortly before.</p>
    <p>Ann-Louise then calls the LAC (Alarm Center) and asks if they have received any reports of a shooting. LAC replies that they are not aware of anything. She informs them that the police have already been alerted, that taxi 2517 is at the scene of the murder, and asks them to send an ambulance. Based on her information, LAC dispatches ambulance 912 to the scene.</p>
    <!-- -->
    <p>Radio operator Ulf H at the Liaison Centre (SBC) sends out an area alert for a shooting at Tunnelgatan-Sveav√§gen. Area 1 covers districts 1, 2, and 3 ‚Äì specifically Norrmalm, √ñstermalm, and S√∂dermalm. Two police units report they are available and are ordered to the scene. Unit 3230 from S√∂dermalm is on Beridarbansgatan. Unit 1230 from Norrmalm is at a gas station at Norra Bantorget, refueling.</p>
