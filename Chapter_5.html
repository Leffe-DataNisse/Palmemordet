    <h1>Chapter 5: Alternative Theories</h1>
    <h2>Police Involvement</h2>
    <p>On June 28, 1982, at about 5 p.m., police assistants Thomas P and Leif T take into custody a person at Sergelstorg in Stockholm. The person's name is Rolf Machnow, a 39-year-old addict. The reason for the arrest is said to be that Machnow is unable to take care of himself due to intoxication. He is taken to a search room that the police and security guards have at T-centralen (Central Station). It is unclear what happens next, but the prosecutor's decision that concludes the police investigation states:</p>
    <div class="quite">
        <p>
        "During his stay in the search room, Machnow's condition becomes such that hospital treatment is deemed necessary. An ambulance is requisitioned. After Machnow is taken to Sabbatsberg Hospital, it is confirmed the same day at 6:15 p.m. that he has died."</p>
    </div>
    <p></p>According to the account of Police Officer Thomas P and Police Officer Leif T</p>:

    <p>When they come into the room, Machnow is placed on the fixed wall bench located along one of the long sides. He comes to sit approximately directly across from the short side of the desk that stands in the room. Machnow sits calmly on the bench while the police officers take notes and requisition transport assistance. After an estimated five minutes, he suddenly gets up. He loses his balance and falls almost headlong forward over the desk, striking his abdomen or diaphragm against the edge of the table. Machnow then bounces backward, back-first, toward the fixed wall bench and further down onto the floor, where he remains lying on his stomach.</p>
    <p>The police officers immediately check if Machnow is injured. He then gets up with the help of the police officers and explains that he feels fine. They then seat him on the bench again. Police Officer D and Police Officer E then return to their places on either side of the desk. After about another five minutes, Machnow suddenly starts to speak incoherently and almost simultaneously falls to the right. As he falls, he twists his body so that the left side of his head strikes the front edge of the bench. Police Officer D then throws himself forward to try to prevent Machnow from falling onto the floor. However, he only manages to get his arms under Machnow at the same time as the latter hits the floor.</p>
    <p>Approximately at the same time as this happens, the police officers who are to assist with the transport arrive.</p>
    <p>The head of the patrol that is to assist with the transport is Police Inspector Håkan O. His account states, among other things:</p>
    <p>Machnow is lying on the floor while Police Officer Thomas P and Police Officer Leif T are sitting at the desk when he and Police Assistant Christina J come into the OT-room. Nothing is said at that time about Machnow being injured. However, Håkan thinks the person in custody looks strange, and furthermore, there is blood on the floor. With the help of Håkan and Christina, Machnow sits up on the bench but sinks down immediately. He then appears to be completely out, and the police officers see that he has a wound on his head. Olsson calls for an ambulance, and while waiting for it, Machnow is laid down on the floor.</p>
    <p>When the ambulance personnel arrive, Machnow shows weak signs of life, and they then give him air and oxygen. In addition to that treatment, the ambulance personnel start chest compressions. The treatment continues during transport to Sabbatsberg Hospital, where he is admitted at 5:55 p.m., and at 6:15 p.m., a doctor confirms that Machnow has died.</p>

    <h3>Swedish Peace Association Files Police Report for Smuggling</h3>
    <p>The Swedish Peace and Arbitration Society (Svenska Freds- och Skiljedomsföreningen) files a police report against the Bofors Board of Directors and CEO for the smuggling of goods.</p>
    <p>On May 29, 1984, the Swedish Peace and Arbitration Society reports the Bofors Board of Directors to the police for violations of the Goods Smuggling Act. The association claims that Bofors, during the years 1979–1980, delivered Robot 70 missiles to Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates (Dubai) via Singapore. The deliveries are alleged to have occurred without export permits and in violation of existing legislation. To support its claims, the association cites a number of articles in international military journals, as well as information and documents obtained from an anonymous source within Bofors. The anonymous source later comes forward and is revealed to be Ingvar Bratt, a former Bofors engineer.</p>

    <p>The National Criminal Section (Rikskriminalsektionen) begins a police investigation in the autumn of 1984 following the report from the Swedish Peace and Arbitration Society.</p>

    <h3>>Algernon dies at T-Centralen.</h3>
    <p>Algernon died when he fell in front of a train at T-Centralen in the Stockholm metro at 5:54 p.m. on January 15, 1987. Earlier that day, Algernon had a meeting with Nobel Industrier's CEO Anders G. Carlberg. During the conversation, Carlberg had told Algernon that an internal investigation had shown that there had been smuggling. Algernon then ended up in a conflict of loyalty. Since he was a key person in the investigation of the Bofors affair, there was speculation that he had been pushed. The police also chose to open a criminal investigation as the train driver, among others, witnessed how Algernon fell backwards onto the tracks. Prosecutor Torsten Wolff closed the investigation on 11 March 1987.</p>

      Later HE came back and presented the whole matter and its background.<br>
      OMAN had bought a “patrol vessel” in the UK – Broke Marine.<br>
      The entire vessel was to be completed in the UK, including a 40 mm autocannon from Bofors.<br>
      My analysis showed that the cannon could be considered part of the system – radar, fire control – British.
